## Hello there 👋

My name is **Davide**, I'm a web developer and partner at [Burning Flame](https://www.burningflame.it) 🔥

I'm in love with **PHP** and I'm a huge **Laravel** enthusiast: I find it to be an incredible framework and its community and ecosystem are no different 🐘 ❤️

Besides that I'm very interested in **React.js**, **Ionic**, **Intertia.js** and, recently, I'm really into **Go** 🚀

When I'm not working I love to be with my family and hang out with my friends, find interesting open source projects, learn new things, read and travel.
